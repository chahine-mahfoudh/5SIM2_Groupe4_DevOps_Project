🚀 Excited to announce the successful completion of my latest project: DevOps implementation for a dynamic Product Management Spring Boot application! 🎿⛷️

Here's a glimpse into our DevOps journey:
🔗 Pulled the Product Management project from GitHub.
📦 Crafted the project's deliverable with precision.
✅ Rigorously tested backend services using JUnit and Mockito for optimal performance on the slopes.
📊 Ensured top-notch source code quality through comprehensive checks with Sonarqube.
🏛️ Seamlessly hosted artifacts using Nexus.
🏗️ Built the Docker image to guarantee a smooth downhill experience.
🐳 Created the Spring Boot deliverable from the Dockerfile, ensuring the application glides seamlessly.
🚀 Published the images on DockerHub, marking a successful ascent to the cloud.
🐋 Containerized deliverables (Spring Boot and MySQL) from their respective images using Docker Compose.
📈 Monitored and visualized data with Grafana and Prometheus for a panoramic view of performance metrics.

Thrilled to share this successful Product Management DevOps journey and eager to explore more opportunities in the tech landscape!
